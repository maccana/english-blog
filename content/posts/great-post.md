This is a Gatsby-driven blog.

In this post we look at how the present tense in English is some times used to talk about events as they happened in the past.Although this is not as common as using a tense such as the Past Progressive when telling anecdotes from the past,it can be used to add a sense of drama in some cases,such as when talking about historic events.
