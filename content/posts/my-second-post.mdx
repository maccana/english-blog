We all love learning English. But there is so much stuff to remember. 
Such as when to use the word 'much' and  when to use 'many'.

Don't worry, in this short post we will clearly explain the use of each. 
By the end you will have many reasons to be proud of your progress!
 
Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the egg yolk will be less rich."? ([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.
